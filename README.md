# Preowned Indian Cars: Price Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes a dataset of pre-owned Indian cars to uncover key insights into pricing trends, brand popularity, and factors influencing resale value. It leverages Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** for data analysis and visualization.

We also trained and compared multiple regression models—including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost**—to predict the resale price of cars accurately.
